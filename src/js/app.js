// React Application Bundle
// This file will contain the extracted React application code
// The original bundled code from index.html should be moved here

// Placeholder for the main application logic
// Original code starts from line 26 to line 49866 in index.html
console.log("Main application will be initialized here");

// The bundled React code contains:
// - React 18.2.0 library
// - Scheduler library
// - Main application components
// - Theme management
// - Search functionality
// - Carousel/card components
// - AI completion features

// Note: This is a very large minified bundle that should be 
// properly extracted and potentially refactored into modules
